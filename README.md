# A simple example of raining effect simulation using WebGL

> Chris, is it raining again there?

## How to run

open `index.html` in your browser

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| startPosition | the level of water |
| k | the stiffness of the spring |
| density |  the dampening factor |
| spread | how fast the waves spread |
| piova | the amount of raindrops generated per second |
| raindropVelocity | the vertical velocity of rain |
| windVelocity | the horizontal velocity of rain |

## Other features

- The value of the parameter can be initialized by url parameters
- The value of the parameter can also be changed in the input box (can breakthrough the limit of the range)
- Url parameter will be updated when you change the value of the parameter

## Problems

- If you toggle the page to background and then toggle back, the animation may be paused
- I don't know what's the best parameters for the simulation

## Performance issues

~~When the value of `piova` is up to 500, the FPS will drop obviously. Since I'm not familiar with WebGL, maybe there are some ways to improve the performance.~~

I change 'draw gl.TRIANGLE_FAN in a for loop' to 'draw gl.TRIANGLES in a single call', and the performance is improved a lotðŸ˜™, now it can process more than 10000 piova easily.

## TODO

- [ ] Balance the raindrops in different position (make sure the water level is horizontal when k is 0)
